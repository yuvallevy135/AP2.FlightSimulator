We implemented MVVM correctly (at least 3 view-model as the instructor requested for the bonus).
extra asthetics:
We implemented a designed bell button that shows whenever there is an error and when you click it, it opens and error log window that you can reset.
When you double-click the Aileron slider - the thumb returns to the 0 value - for more comfort.
The plane icon is centered in the middle of the map so you won't have to follow it manually.
The windows in this project are fully resizeble.
We added a status indication in the main window - so you will be able to know when you are connected/disconncted.
The disconnect bottun isn't availble when your status is disconncted and vise versa.
